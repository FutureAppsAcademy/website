Future Apps Academy was born from a desire to extend the impact of our successful experiences within the GT iOS Club to a broader audience. While leading the GT iOS Club, we saw how hands-on learning and mentorship could transform students into confident, skilled app developers. However, we realized that many students outside of Georgia Tech’s community lacked access to similar opportunities and resources.

Determined to bridge this gap, we founded Future Apps Academy with the mission of empowering high school students everywhere with the skills to create their own iOS apps. Our intensive 2-week bootcamps are designed to provide practical coding skills, foster creativity, and build problem-solving abilities, regardless of students’ prior experience or background.

Our primary goal is to broaden our impact and reach beyond the confines of the GT community. We believe that every student deserves the chance to learn, innovate, and succeed in the tech world. By offering comprehensive and accessible training, we aim to inspire the next generation of app developers and equip them with the tools to turn their ideas into reality.

Since our inception, we’ve been committed to delivering top-quality instruction, hands-on projects, and a supportive community where students can thrive. We are excited to continue this journey, helping more young minds unlock their potential and make their mark in the tech industry.
